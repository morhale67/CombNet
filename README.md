# CombNet
Combination of 2 nets from the 2 different papers:

first net:
https://github.com/morhale67/CombNet/blob/main/papers/Learning%20from%20simulation%20An%20end-to-end%20deep-learning%20approach%20for%20computational%20ghost%20imaging.pdf

second: (XNet)
https://github.com/morhale67/CombNet/blob/main/papers/XNet%20A%20convolutional%20neural%20network%20(CNN)%20implemention%20for%20medical%20x-ray%20image%20segmention%20suitable%20for%20small%20datasets.pdf

The goal is to try reconstruct an image from simulated GI detector data.
The first net getting reconstruction and the second net is for sharpening the first net output.
